# PC Builder Project
This project started as a way to delve deeper into React and explore my interest in PC building. 

One of the biggest challenges I had to face while creating this project was ensuring compatibility between different components.  Figuring out how to effectively manage this complexity within the React framework was a puzzle I thoroughly enjoyed solving. Learning to leverage React's component structure to represent different parts and their attributes was difficult, but overall made the codebase easier to maintain and understand.

Another challenge was the user interface (UI). Balancing between displaying the form and providing a user-friendly experience took quite a bit of time.

Here are a few features I'd love to add:
- Improvement in overall design of the PC Part Builder App, especially the Component Input Form
- Dynamically displaying the total cost as the user continues to add to the PC Part Builder.
- Adding a button that allows to user to add additional components, further increasing personal customization.

Overall, this project has been an amazing learning experience. I plan to continue working on it and making it become one of my key projects on my resume.
